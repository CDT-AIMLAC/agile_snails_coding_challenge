## Aims & Objectives

- Predict on site power generation at 30 minute intervals for at least the next 24 hours. The National Grid charges a penalty fee for any power generator who over estimates their power output and is unable to deliver.
- Automatically decide upon a price to sell any excess electricity to the National Grid. The price must be as profitable as possible while still being competitive with the general wholesale market. This must be specified at 30 minute intervals.
- Produce a regular report for management stating:
	- Revenue from selling electricity
	- Cost of imported electricity
	- Cost savings compared to buying from the National Grid at a rate of 15 pence per kilowatt hour
	- Carbon dioxide savings compared to buying from the National Grid. *Note that the carbon intensity of the grid varies.*
